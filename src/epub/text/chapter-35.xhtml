			</header>
			<p>I have this moment the honour of your Ladyship’s Letter, and I will not wait another, before I return an answer.</p>
			<p>It seldom happens that a man, though extolled as a saint, is really without blemish; or that another, though reviled as a devil, is really without humanity. Perhaps the time is not very distant, when I may have the honour to convince your Ladyship of this truth, in regard to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Villars and myself.</p>
			<p>As to the young lady, whom <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Villars so obligingly proposes presenting to me, I wish her all the happiness to which, by your ladyship’s account, she seems entitled; and, if she has a third part of the merit of <em>her</em> to whom you compare her, I doubt not but <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Villars will be more successful in every other application he may make for her advantage, than he can ever be in any with which he may be pleased to favour me.</p>
